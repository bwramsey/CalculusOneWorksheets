\begin{problem}
A plane flying horizontally at an altitude of 800m and speed of 200 m/sec passes directly over a spectator at an air show. (See figure below.)  Find the rate at which the angle of elevation, $\theta$, is changing 4 seconds later. Make sure to label the figure. ($\theta =$\ angle between the ground and the line from the spectator to the plane)
