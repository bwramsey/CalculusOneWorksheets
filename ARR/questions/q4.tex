\begin{problem}
A cylindrical swimming pool with a radius of 10 feet and height of 5 feet is being filled with water.  How fast is the water being pumped into the pool (in ft$^3$/min) if the water level is increasing at a rate of 6 in/minute?  Make sure to draw a picture to represent the situation.

	\begin{align*}
		\frac{dh}{dt}&=6 \text{in/min}=.5 \text{feet/min}\\
		V&=\pi r^2h=\pi(100)h \\
		\frac{dV}{dt}&=100\pi \frac{dh}{dt}\\
		\frac{dV}{dt}&=100 \pi (.5)=50 \pi \text{ft}^3\text{/min}
