		This is an Initial Value Problem. First we find the general solution of the differential equation.
		
		$$f(t) = t^4 + t^2 + C .$$
		Then, we find the unique solution of the IVP.
		$$ 5 = f(3) = 3^4 + 3^2 + C = 81 + 9 + C = 90 + C$$
		$$\Longrightarrow \quad  C = -85 $$
		and so
		$$ f(t) = t^4 + t^2 - 85. $$
