\begin{problem}
Consider an object moving along a straight line. The graphs of acceleration function (in $m/s^2$), the  velocity function and the position function of the object are given in the figure below.

  Find the initial velocity, $v(0)$, and initial position, $s(0)$, of the object. (HINT: Start by determining which graph corresponds to each of $s(t)$, $v(t)$, and $a(t)$.)

   \begin{freeResponse}
  It is clear that the function $B$ is the velocity. Therefore, $v(0)=3$.
    It is clear that the function $A$ is the position function. Therefore, $s(0)=0$.
