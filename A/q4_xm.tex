\begin{problem}
 The graph of a function $f$ is the parabola given in the figure below.
  \begin{image}

  \end{image}
  
  \begin{enumerate}

    \item
      Find a formula for $f(x)$.
      
\item
      Suppose  $F_1$ is an anti-derivatives of $f$ satisfying $F_1(0)=2$. Sketch and label the graph of $F_1$. \\
Sketch the graphs of three more antiderivatives of $f$.\\  

\item
      Using the expression you found in part (a) and your sketches  in part (b), find the algebraic representation of  $F_1$.
      
\item
      Suppose we're given $h(x) = (1/3)x^3 +17 $, what is $h'(x)$?
      
\item
      What is the relationship between $f$, $F_1$, $h$, and $h'$?
