	\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Find the values of $t$ in $(0,4)$ at which $g$ is not continuous.
		\begin{freeResponse}
		$g$ is not continuous at $t=1$.
		\end{freeResponse}

	\item Find the values of $t$ in $(0,4)$ at which $g$ is not differentiable.
		\begin{freeResponse}
		$g$ is not differentiable at $t=1$, because $g$ is not continuous there, and  at $t=2$, because $g$ has a "cusp" there.
		\end{freeResponse}
\WkstHop
		\end{enumerate}
