\begin{problem}
A company is producing cell phones. The cost of producing  $x$ cell phones is given by $C(x)$, defined by
\[
C(x)=-0.01x^2+40x+400, \text{  for } 0\le x<1000.
\]
AVERAGE cost of producing the first $x$ cell phones is given by

\[
C_{AVG}=\frac{C(x)}{x}
\]

If the company has produced $x$ cell phones, the cost of producing one more item is given by

\[
\text{COST of producing one more item}=C(x+1)-C(x)
\]

MARGINAL COST is approximation of the cost of producing one more cell phone

\[
\text{MARGINAL COST}=C'(x)
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the average cost of the first $300$ cellphones that the company produces.
\item Compute the cost of producing one more cell phone, if the company has produced $300$ cell phones.
	
\item Compute the marginal cost, if $300$ cell phones have been produced.
\item Why is the marginal cost a good approximation of the cost of producing one more item?  Explain!
\end{enumerate}
