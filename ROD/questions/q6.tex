\begin{problem}
A company is producing cell phones. The cost of producing  $x$ cell phones is given by $C(x)$, defined by
\[
C(x)=-0.01x^2+40x+400, \text{  for } 0\le x<1000.
\]
AVERAGE cost of producing the first $x$ cell phones is given by

\[
C_{AVG}=\frac{C(x)}{x}
\]

If the company has produced $x$ cell phones, the cost of producing one more item is given by


\[
\text{COST of producing one more item}=C(x+1)-C(x)
\]

MARGINAL COST is approximation of the cost of producing one more cell phone

\[
\text{MARGINAL COST}=C'(x)
\]
 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the average cost of the first $300$ cellphones that the company produces.
\WkstHop
	\begin{freeResponse}
		The first 300 cell phones costs, on average, 
		
		\[
		C_{AVG}=\frac{C(300)}{300}=38.33
		\]
	\end{freeResponse}
	\item Compute the cost of producing one more cell phone, if the company has produced $300$ cell phones.
	\begin{freeResponse}
\[
C(301)-C(300)=-0.01(301)^2+40(301)+400-(-0.01(300)^2+40(300)+400)=33.99
\]
\end{freeResponse}
\item Compute the marginal cost, if $300$ cell phones have been produced.
\WkstHop
\begin{freeResponse}
\[
\text{MARGINAL COST}=C'(300)=\bigl[0.02x+40\bigr]_{x=300} =34
\]
\end{freeResponse}
\item Why is the marginal cost a good approximation of the cost of producing one more item?  Explain!
\WkstHop
\begin{freeResponse}
		By the definition of the derivative we have that
		
		\[
		C'(300)=\lim_{h \to 0}\dfrac{C(300+h)-C(300)}{h}\approx \dfrac{C(300+h)-C(300)}{h}
		\]
		for any $h$ near $0$. In particular, for $h=1$, we obtain
		\[
		C'(300)\approx \dfrac{C(300+1)-C(300)}{1}=C(301)-C(300),
		\]
Therefore, marginal cost at $x=300 \approx$ the cost of producing one more item!
