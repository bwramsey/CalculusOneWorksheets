	Consider the parabola $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ where $a,b,c$ are constants.  For what values of $a,b,c$ is $f$ concave up?  For what values of $a,b,c$ is $f$ concave down?

		\begin{align*}
			f'(x)&=2ax+b\\
			f''(x)&=2a
		\end{align*}
		This means the sign of $a$ will determine whether $f$ is concave up or down.  When $a<0$, $f$ is concave down, which makes sense 
		because then the graph of $f$ is a downward opening parabola.  When $a>0$, $f$ is concave up, which makes sense because then the 
		graph of $f$ is an upward openng parabola.  If $a=0$, $f$ has no concavity because it is a linear function.
