\section*{SUMMARY of the Extreme Value Theorem}

A function $f$ has a \textbf{global maximum} at $x=a$, if $f(a)\ge f(x)$, for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.\\[1em]
A function $f$ has a \textbf{global minimum} at $x=a$, if $f(a)\le f(x)$, for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.\\[2em]

\begin{theorem}[Extreme Value Theorem (EVT)]
	If a function $f$ is \textbf{continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$}, then  $f$ attains  both 
	a  global maximum and a global minimum on  the closed interval $[a,b]$.
\end{theorem}

\textbf{Note: }If a function $f$ has a global extremum (minimum or maximum) at $x=c$, then $c$ is either a boundary point (which means that $c=a$ or $c=b$), or $f$ has a critical point at $x=c$.\\[1em]
So, if we have to find an extreme value of $f$ on $[a,b]$, we should check all the boundary and all the critical points of f and compare the values of $f$ at those points.
 The biggest of those values is the maximum value of $f$ on $[a,b]$, and the smallest one is the minimum value of $f$ on $[a,b]$.\\[2em]

\section*{SUMMARY of The Mean Value Theorem}


\begin{theorem}[The Mean Value Theorem (MVT)]
If a function $f$ is \textbf{continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$}, and \textbf{differentiable on $(a,b)$}, then there exists a point $c$ in the open interval $(a,b)$ such that
\[ f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\]
\end{theorem}
\textbf{Note 1a: }The value $\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$ is the slope of the (secant) line through the points $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$. \\[1em]
\textbf{Note 1b: }The line tangent to the graph of $f$ at the point where $x=c$ is \textbf{parallel} to the line through the points  $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$. \\[1em]
\textbf{Note 2a: }The value $\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$ is the average rate of change of $f$ on the interval $[a,b]$. \\[1em]
\textbf{Note 2b: }The instantaneous rate of change $f$ at the point where $x=c$ is equal to the average rate of change of $f$ on $[a,b]$. \\[1em]

\begin{problem}
Find the  x-coordinates of global extrema and global extreme values  of $f$  on the given interval.
		\begin{enumerate}
		
			%part a
			\item  $f(x) = x \sqrt{2-x^2}$ on $[ -\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2} ]$.
\WkstHop
				
				\begin{freeResponse}
				First note that $f$ is continuous on this closed interval so, by the Extreme Value Theorem, it must attain a maximum and minimum value on the interval $[-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}]$. Those global extrema must occur
				either at critical points or at the boundary points.
				\begin{align*}
				f'(x) &= \sqrt{2-x^2} + x \left( \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2-x^2}} (-2x) \right) \\
				&= \sqrt{2-x^2} - \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2-x^2}} \\
				&= \frac{2-x^2-x^2}{\sqrt{2-x^2}} \\
				&= \frac{2(1-x^2)}{\sqrt{2-x^2}}
				\end{align*}
				
				Critical points of $f$ occur where $f'(x) = 0$ or where $f'(x)$ does not exist.  Solving $f'(x) = 0$ yields that $2(1-x^2) = 0$, or $x = \pm 1$.  $f'(x)$ does not exist when $2-x^2 \leq 0$.  But since we are restricting to the interval $[-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}]$, the only points where $f'(x)$ does not exist are the endpoints $\pm \sqrt{2}$.  
				
				The critical points of $f$ in the interval $[-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}]$ are $x = \pm 1$. (The points $x = \pm \sqrt{2}$ technically are not critical points since they are the endpoints of the domain of $f$.)  The functin $f$ must attain its maximum and minimum values in this set $x =\{ \pm 1, \pm \sqrt{2}\}$.  
				We compute
				\begin{align*}
					f(-\sqrt{2}) &= 0 \\
					f(\sqrt{2}) &= 0\\
					f(1) &= 1 \sqrt{2-1} = 1\\
					f(-1) &= -1 \sqrt{2-(-1)^2} = -1
				\end{align*}
				
				That means $f$ has a maximum value of $1$ (at $x= 1$) and a minimum value of -1 (at $x= -1 $) over the interval $[-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}]$.
				\end{freeResponse}
				
				
				
			%part b
			\item  $f(x) = x^3 e^{-x}$ on $[-1,5]$.
\WkstHop
			
				\begin{freeResponse}
				First note that $f$ is continuous on this closed interval so, by the Extreme Value Theorem, it must attain a maximum and minimum value on the interval $[-1,5]$. Those global extrema must occur
				either at critical points or at the boundary points.
				\begin{align*}
					f'(x) &= 3x^2 e^{-x} + x^3(-e^{-x}) \\
					&= x^2 e^{-x} (3-x)
				\end{align*}
				
				Notice that $f'(x)$ always exists so any critical point of must $f$ occur when $f'(x)=0$.  Solving this equation:
				\begin{align*}
					x^2 e^{-x} (3-x) &= 0 \\
					x^2 (3-x) & = 0 \\
				 	x & = 0 \qquad \text{or} \qquad x=3	
				 \end{align*}
				
				Since both critical points are in the given interval, the global extrema must occur at the points $x=-1,0,3,5$.
				\begin{align*}
					f(-1) &= -e \\
					f(0) &= 0 \\
				 	f(3) &= 27e^{-3} \\
				 	f(5) &= 125 e^{-5}
				\end{align*}
				
				Since $-e$ is the only negative value, the minimum value of $f$ over the interval is $-e$.  Since $e^3 < 27$, $27e^{-3} > 1$.  But $e^5 > 125$, and so $125e^{-5} < 1$.  Thus the maximum value of $f$ over the interval is $27e^{-3}$.  
		
				\end{freeResponse}
\WkstNew
				
				
				
			%part c
			\item  $f(x) = x \ln \left( \frac{x}{5} \right)$ on $[0.1, 5]$.
\WkstHop
			
				\begin{freeResponse}
				First note that $f$ is continuous on this closed interval so, by the Extreme Value Theorem, it must attain a maximum and minimum value on the interval $[0.1,5]$.
				\begin{align*}
					f'(x) &= \ln \left( \frac{x}{5} \right) + x \cdot \frac{5}{x} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \\
					&= \ln \left( \frac{x}{5} \right) + 1
				\end{align*}
				
				Notice that $f'(x)$ exists for all values in $[0.1,5]$, and so all of the critical points of $f$ occur when $f'(x)=0$.  Solving this equation:
				$$ \ln \left( \frac{x}{5} \right) + 1 = 0 $$
				$$ \ln \left( \frac{x}{5} \right) = -1 $$
				$$ \frac{x}{5} = e^{-1} $$
				$$ x = 5e^{-1} = \frac{5}{e} $$
				
				Since $1 < \frac{5}{e} < 2$, $\frac{5}{e}$ is in the given interval.  So we need to consider the points $x = \frac{1}{10}, \frac{5}{e}, 5$.
				$$ f \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) = \frac{1}{10} \ln \left( \frac{1}{50} \right)  = \frac{1}{10} \left( \ln 1 - \ln 50 \right) = -\frac{1}{10} \ln 50 $$
				$$ f \left( \frac{5}{e} \right) = \frac{5}{e} \ln \left( \frac{1}{e} \right) = - \frac{5}{e} $$
				$$ f(5) = 5 \ln 1 = 0 $$
				
				Since the first two values are negative, $0$ is the maximum value of $f$ on $[0.1,5]$.  Also, since $e^{10} > 50$, $\ln 50 < 10$ and therefore $-1 < -\frac{1}{10} \ln 50$.  But clearly $\frac{-5}{e} < -1$, and so $- \frac{5}{e}$ is the minimum value of $f$ on $[0.1, 5]$.

\begin{problem}
  Verify that the given function satisfies the hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem in the given interval.
  Then algebraically find all numbers $c$ that satisfy the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem.
  Using the graph provided, label the point(s) $c$ and sketch the secant line through the points $(1,f(1))$ and $(4,f(4))$ and the tangent line at $c$.
  $$ f(x) = \frac{x}{x+2} \qquad \text{on } [1,4] $$.
  \begin{image}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Images/Figure3.png}
  \end{image}
\WkstHop
  \begin{freeResponse}
    The function $f(x) = \frac{x}{x+2}$ is continuous on $[1,4]$ and differentiable on $(1,4)$ since it is a rational function, and is therefore continuous and differentiable on its domain.
    Therefore, $f$ satisfies the hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem.
    We have that
    $$ f'(x) = \frac{(x+2)(1) - x(1)}{(x+2)^2} = \frac{2}{(x+2)^2} $$
    $$ \frac{f(4) - f(1)}{4-1} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3}}{3} = \frac{1}{9} $$
    So we are looking to find all points $c \in (1,4)$ which satisfy that $ f'(c) = \frac{1}{9} $.  So we solve:
    $$ \frac{2}{(c+2)^2} = \frac{1}{9} $$
    $$ (c+2)^2 = 18 $$
    $$ c = \sqrt{18} - 2 = 3\sqrt{2} - 2 $$
    Note that we omitted $-\sqrt{18} - 2$ above because it is not in the interval $(1,4)$.  Therefore, $c = 3\sqrt{2} - 2$.

\WkstHop
      \begin{freeResponse}

          $$m_{\text{sec}} = \frac{f(8) - f(1)}{8 - 1}= \frac{1 - 8}{7} = \frac{-7}{7} = -1$$

    \item
      Show that the function $f$ satisfies the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem on the interval $[1, 8]$ and find a point (or points) guaranteed to exist by the Mean Value Theorem.
\WkstHop
      \begin{freeResponse}
        $f$ is continuous on the interval $[1, 8]$, $f$ is differentiable on the interval $(1, 8)$.
        By the Mean Value Theorem there exists a(t least one) point $c$ in $(1, 8)$ such that
        \[
          f'(c) = \frac{f(8) - f(1)}{8 - 1} = -1
        \]

        Now $f'(x) = -8/x^2$ hence
        \begin{align*}
          f'(c) = -1 &\iff \frac{-8}{c^2} = -1 \\
                     &\iff c^2 = 8 \\
                     &\iff c= \pm 2\sqrt{2}
        \end{align*}
        Since $c$ must be in $(1, 8)$ we have that $c = 2\sqrt{2}$ is the only point in $(1, 8)$ with $f'(c) = -1$.

  In figure(A), the secant line connecting the points $(1,f(1))$ and $(5,f(5))$ is also a tangent line to the curve  at $x$, $1<x<3$.
    
          (A): $\frac{f(5)-f(1)}{5-1}=\frac{1-5}{4}=-1$ and for any $c$ in $(1,5), f'(c)=-1$.\\
          (C):$\frac{f(5)-f(1)}{5-1}$ is the slope of the secant line connecting the points $(1,f(1))$ and $(5,f(5))$. This line is parallel to two tangent lines shown in the figure (C). The lines have the same slope. The slope of either of a  tangent line is $f'(s)$, where is $(s, f(s))$ is the point where the line touches the curve.\\
          (B): The slope of the secant line connecting $(1,f(1))$ and $(5,f(5))$ is negative On the other hand $f'(s)>0$, for $1<s<3$ and $3<s<5$.
          So, $\frac{f(5)-f(1)}{5-1}=\frac{1-5}{4}=-\frac{1}{4}\ne f'(s)$, for all $s$ where $f'(s)$ defined.

  Let $f(x) = (x-3)^{-2}$.
  Show that there is no value $c$ in $(1,4)$ such that $f(4) - f(1) = f^{\prime}(c) (4-1)$.
  Why does this not contradict the Mean Value Theorem?
\WkstHop
  \begin{freeResponse}
    First notice that 
    $$f(4)-f(1) = 1^{-2} - (-2)^{-2} = 1-\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$$
    and so we are looking for a value $c$ such that 
    $$3 f^\prime (c) = \frac{3}{4} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad f^\prime (c) = \frac{1}{4} $$
    Then since $f'(x) = \frac{-2}{(x-3)^3}$, we can compute:
    $$ f'(c) = \frac{-2}{(c-3)^3} := \frac{1}{4}$$
    $$ (c-3)^3 = - 8 $$
    $$ c = 3 - 2 = 1 $$
    But $1$ is not in the interval $(1,4)$.  This does not contradict the Mean Value Theorem since $f$ is not continuous at $x=3$.

  Two runners start a race at the same time and finish in a tie.
  Prove that at some time during the race they have the same speed. 
  (Hint:  Consider the function $h(t)=f(t)-g(t)$, where $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ are the position of the first and second runner at time $t$, respectively.)
\WkstHop
  \begin{freeResponse}
    Let $f(t)$ be the position of the first runner at time $t$, and let $g(t)$ be the position of the second runner at time $t$.
    Let $T$ denote the time that the two runners finish the race (which is the same, since they finish in a tie).
    Also, let $h(t) = f(t) - g(t)$.
    Since $h(0) = 0$ and $h(T) = 0$, by Rolle's Theorem there exists some $c$ with $0 < c < T$ such that $h'(c)=0$.
    But since $h^\prime (t) = f^\prime (t) - g^\prime (t)$, we have that $f^\prime (c) = g^\prime (c)$.
    Therefore, the runners have the same speed at time $c$.

  Verify that the given function satisfies the hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem in the given interval.
  Then algebraically find all numbers $c$ that satisfy the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem.
  $$ f(x) = x+\sin{\Bigl(\frac{\pi}{4}\cdot x\Bigr)} \qquad \text{on } [0,2] $$.
\WkstHop

   \begin{freeResponse}
   The function $f$ is continuous on $[0,2]$ and differentiable on $(0,2)$ since it is a sum of a linear polynomial and a composition of a sine function  and another linear polynomial. Therefore, $f$ satisfies the hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem.
    We have that
    $$ f'(x) = 1+\frac{\pi}{4}\cdot\cos{\Bigl(\frac{\pi}{4}\cdot x\Bigr)}  $$
    $$ \frac{f(2) - f(0)}{2-0} = \frac{3}{2} $$
    So we are looking to find all points $c \in (0,2)$ which satisfy that $ f'(c) = \frac{3}{2} $.  So we solve:
    $$  1+\frac{\pi}{4}\cdot\cos{\Bigl(\frac{\pi}{4}\cdot c\Bigr)} = \frac{3}{2} $$
    Therefore,
    $$  \frac{\pi}{4}\cdot\cos{\Bigl(\frac{\pi}{4}\cdot c\Bigr)} = \frac{1}{2} $$
    and
 $$  \cos{\Bigl(\frac{\pi}{4}\cdot c\Bigr)} = \frac{2}{\pi} $$
  $$ \frac{\pi}{4}\cdot c = \arccos{\Bigl(\frac{2}{\pi}\Bigr) }$$
    $$  c =\frac{4}{\pi}\cdot \arccos{\Bigl(\frac{2}{\pi}\Bigr)\approx 1.12 }$$
    Let's confirm this result with the graph.
