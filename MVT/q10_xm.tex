\begin{problem}
  Two runners start a race at the same time and finish in a tie.
  Prove that at some time during the race they have the same speed. 
  (Hint:  Consider the function $h(t)=f(t)-g(t)$, where $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ are the position of the first and second runner at time $t$, respectively.)
