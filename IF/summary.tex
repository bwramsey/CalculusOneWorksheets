\textbf{Some notes on notation for finding limits:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bf The first step in evaluating any limit is to find the form.} This is true, even if the question does not specifically ask for the form.

	\item To find the form of $\lim_{x \to a}\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, take the limits of the numerator and denominator SEPARATELY. Do not just ``plug in $x=a$''. ``Plugging in'' can not occur until after the function is noticed as continuous.
	
	\item When writing a form of a limit, we NEVER write $\lim_{x \to a}\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\frac{0}{0}$.  It is the $=$ that makes this a mathematically incorrect statement.  Instead, write $\lim_{x \to a}\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ is of the form $\frac{0}{0}$. 



	\item When evaluating limits, do NOT drop the $\lim_{x \to a}$ until you have evaluated the limit.  For example, the following is INCORRECT:
	\begin{center}
		$\lim_{x \to 2}\frac{2x^2-4x}{x-2}=\frac{2x(x-2)}{x-2}=2x=4$\\	
	\end{center}

	Instead, we write: 
	\begin{center}
		$\lim_{x \to 2}\frac{2x^2-4x}{x-2}=\lim_{x \to 2}\frac{2x(x-2)}{x-2}=\lim_{x \to 2}2x=4$\\	
	\end{center}

\end{enumerate}
