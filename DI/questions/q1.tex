  Consider the following limit of Riemann sums of a function $g$ on $[a, b]$:
  \[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k = 1}^n (x_k^* + \cos(x_k^*)) \Delta x\mbox{ , $[0, \pi]$.}
  \]
  Express the limit as a definite integral. Use geometry to evaluate the resulting definite integral.

    We have 
    \[
      \int_0^\pi(x + \cos(x))\d x = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k = 1}^n (x_k^* + \cos(x_k^*)) \Delta x.
    \]
    
    To evaluate this definite integral, we'll start by writing $\displaystyle \int_0^\pi(x + \cos(x))\d x = \int_0^\pi x \d x + \int_0^\pi \cos(x) \d x$.
    
    The first term is the definite integral $\displaystyle \int_0^\pi x \d x$ which is the net area under the graph of $y = x$ on the interval $[0,\pi]$. This is a triangle of base $\pi$ and height $\pi$, so it has area $\dfrac{1}{2} \pi ^ 2$.
 
    The second term $\displaystyle \int_0^\pi \cos(x) \d x$ is the net area between the graph of $y = \cos(x)$ and the $x$-axis on the interval $[0, \pi]$. In the interval $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$ the function is positive, and in the interval $[\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi]$ the function is negative. By the symmetry of the cosine function, these two regions have the same geometric area, so the net area is zero.
 
    $\displaystyle \int_0^\pi(x + \cos(x))\d x = \int_0^\pi x \d x + \int_0^\pi \cos(x) \d x = \dfrac{\pi^2}{2}$.
