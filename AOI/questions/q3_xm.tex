\begin{problem}
	Assume that the {\it rate of change} (in dollars per day) of the price of shares of stock
	in the WeSaySo Company (with $t$ in days) is modeled by the equation $r(t) = -3t^2+30t-63$
	(note that this is technically a {\it discrete} function, but prices change so often with stocks that modeling this with a continuous function makes sense).
	Assume also that the price of a share of stock on day $1$ (i.e., $t=1$) is $\$51$.
	Answer the following questions:
	\begin{enumerate}

	\item  Find the rate of change of price at $t=5$.
		\item  Find the price of a share of stock at $t=5$.
		\item  How fast is the rate of change of price changing at $t=5$?
		\item  How much did the price of a share of stock change in the first $6$ days (i.e., on $[1,6]$)?
		\item  What was the greatest rate of change of price during the first $6$ days (i.e., on $[1,6]$)?
		[3]

	\item  What was the greatest price of a share of stock during the first $6$ days (i.e., on $[1,6]$)?
		[3]
