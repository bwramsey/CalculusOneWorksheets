\begin{problem}

Solve the following word problems:

	\begin{enumerate}

	\item  The velocity function for an object moving along a line east/west is given by
	$v(t) = -t^2 + 4t - 3$ feet per minute.

		\begin{enumerate}

		\item  Find the total displacement the object traveled from $2$ minutes to $6$ minutes (assume east is positive).
		\item  Find the total distance the object traveled from $2$ minutes to $6$ minutes.
		\item  Suppose that the object's position $2$ minutes into the trip is $5$ feet of a placement marker.  What is its position (relative to the placement marker) at $6$ minutes.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item  Sammy the Snail sets up camp in the median of I-70 and, starting at noon and ending at 6pm, hikes back and forth along the highway.  He starts his hike at his campsite.  His velocity at time $t$ hours (after noon)  is given by $v(t)=(t-2)(t-5)$ inches per hour.  Find the total distance Sammy travelled on his hike.
