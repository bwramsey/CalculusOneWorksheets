\begin{problem}

Suppose that $r(t) = r_0 e^{-kt}$ (with $k>0$) is the rate at which a nation extracts oil.
The current rate of extraction is $r(0) = 10^7$ barrels/yr.
Also assume that the estimate of the total oil reserve (ie, the amount of oil remaining beneath the ground in this country) is $2 \times 10^9$ barrels.

	\begin{enumerate}

	\item  Find $A(t)$, the total amount of oil extracted by the nation after $t$ years.
		\item  Evaluate $\lim_{t \to \infty} A(t)$ and explain the meaning of this limit.
		%		
	\item  Find the minimum constant $k$ for which the total oil reserves will last forever.
		\item  Suppose that the  constant k is half the minimum value found in part (c). When will the nation deplete its oil reserve?
		\end{enumerate}
