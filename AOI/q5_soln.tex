\begin{problem}
	The graph of a function $f$ defined on the interval $[0,6]$  is given in the figure.
  
        \begin{image}
          \includegraphics[scale = 0.6]{figure5.png}
        \end{image}
     \begin{enumerate}
	     \item Compute the net area of the region between the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis, on the interval $[0,6]$.
		[3]
		     \begin{explanation}
		     The net area $= -1/2 + 1/2 +1 +3+1=5$
		     \end{explanation}
        
     \item Draw a rectangle with base on the $x$-axis, $0\leq x \leq 6$, whose area is equal to the net area in part (a).
  		\begin{explanation}
	     Let $A$ be the area of the rectangle.  Then $A=$(base)(height)$=6h=5$.  \\
	     So, $6h=5 \implies h=\frac{5}{6}$
	            \begin{image}
  			        \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{figure6.png}
        		\end{image}
     	\end{explanation}
     
       \item In the figure, mark a point $c$ in $(0,6)$ such that $f(c)$ is the height of the rectangle from part (b).
		\begin{explanation}
    		$f(c)=h=\frac{5}{6}$
            \begin{image}
          		\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{figure7.png}
        	\end{image}
        	Note: In this example, there is only one such point $c$.  In some cases there may be more than one.
     	\end{explanation}
     
     
     \item Using the figure and parts (a-c), what is the relationship between the rectangle from part (b), the 
     	net area from part (a), and the average value of $f$ on $[0, 6]$?
		[3]
	      \begin{explanation}
    		    The Mean Value Theorem for integrals states that there exists a point $d$ in $(a, b)$ such that
		        \[
		          f(d) = \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x) \d x.
		        \]
		        The right-hand side of this equation is the average value of $f$ on $[a, b]$.
		
		        Rewriting we have
		        \[
		        f(d) \cdot (b-a) = \int_a^b f(x) \d x.
		        \]
		      The right-hand side of this equation is the net area found in part (a): $\int_0^6 f(x) \d x=5$.\\
		       The left-hand side of this equation is the area of the rectangle in part (b).  The point $d$ is the point $c$ we found in part (c).  From (b) and (c), $f(c)=\frac{5}{6}$ is the average value of $f$ on $[0,6]$.
		 \end{explanation}
    \end{enumerate}
