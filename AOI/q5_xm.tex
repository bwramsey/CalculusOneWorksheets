\begin{problem}
	The graph of a function $f$ defined on the interval $[0,6]$  is given in the figure.
  
        \begin{image}
          \includegraphics[scale = 0.6]{figure5.png}
        \end{image}
     \begin{enumerate}
	     \item Compute the net area of the region between the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis, on the interval $[0,6]$.
		[3]

     \item Draw a rectangle with base on the $x$-axis, $0\leq x \leq 6$, whose area is equal to the net area in part (a).
  		\item In the figure, mark a point $c$ in $(0,6)$ such that $f(c)$ is the height of the rectangle from part (b).
		\item Using the figure and parts (a-c), what is the relationship between the rectangle from part (b), the 
     	net area from part (a), and the average value of $f$ on $[0, 6]$?
