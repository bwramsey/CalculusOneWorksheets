\begin{problem}
	Select the meaning of $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)=6$.  Support your explanation graphically.

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item As $x$ becomes arbitrarily negatively large, $f(x)$ approaches $6$.
	\item As $x$ becomes arbitrarily positively large, $f(x)$ approaches $6$.
	\item As $x$ approaches 6, $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily negatively large.
	\item As $x$ approaches 6, $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily positively large.
	\end{enumerate}
