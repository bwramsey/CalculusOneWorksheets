\begin{problem}
 Sketch a possible graph of a function that satisfies all of the given properties.
  (You \emph{do not} need to find a formula for the function.)
  \begin{align*}
 	\lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) &= \infty &   f(-2) &= -5 &  f(1) &= 2 \\
	 \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) &= -\infty & \lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) &= 4 & \lim_{x \to 5} f(x) &= \infty \\
	 \lim_{x \to 3} f(x) &= 3 & f(3) &=  1 &\\
	  \lim_{x \to -2^+}f(x)&=-5  & f(4) &\text{ is undefined}& \lim_{x \to 4}f(x)&=3\\
  \end{align*}

      There are many correct solutions to this problem.
  One possible solution can be constructed as follows:
	First we draw the given points.  We'll also draw open brackets on the x-axis at $x=4$ since $f(x)$ is not defined at $x=4$ (This is seen in green.)

	Then we draw the vertical  and horizontal asymptotes (in purple) and arrows indicating how the graph approaches the asymptote (in blue).  We also draw end-behavior as $x$ approaches $\infty$ and $-\infty$ (in blue).  We can also draw tails where we know limits at particular x-values.  Such as $ \lim_{x \to -2^+}f(x)=-5$.

	Finally we connect our graph together (seen in blue)
