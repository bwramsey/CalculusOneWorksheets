		Let $u = \tan(x)$. Then $du = \sec^2(x) dx$, and so
		\begin{align*}
			\int sec^2(x) \tan(x) \, \d x &= \int u du\\
				&= \dfrac{1}{2}u^2 + C\\
				&= \dfrac{1}{2}\tan^2(x) + C.
		\end{align*}
		NOTE: The substitution $v = \sec(x)$ would also work to solve this problem, as would the substitution $w = \sec^2(x)$. 
		It is a good exercise to work these out!
