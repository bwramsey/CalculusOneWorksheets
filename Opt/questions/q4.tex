\begin{problem}
A box with two square sides is constructed to have a volume of 27. Denote the dimensions of the length of the base as $y$, and the width and height as $x$, as labeled in the diagram below. Find the dimensions needed to minimize the surface area of the box.

		Solve the problem by performing the following steps.

		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Find a formula for $S(x)$ the surface area of the box, as a function of only the variable $x$.

        				The volume of the box is given by $V=x^2 y$ and the surface area is given by $S = 2x^2 + 4xy$. We are told that the volume of the box is 27, which means our constraint is that $x^2y = 27$, so that $y = \frac{27}{x^2}$. Plugging this into the surface area formula gives 
        				\[ S(x) = 2x^2 + 4x\left( \frac{27}{x^2} \right) = 2x^2 + \frac{108}{x} \]
			      \end{freeResponse}
			\item Find the{interval of interest} for $S(x)$. 
\WkstHop
 				\begin{freeResponse}
        				Because $x$ represents a side-length of this box, it cannot be negative. Moreover, the function $S(x)$ is not defined at $x=0$,
        				so $x$ has to be positive. The Interval of Interest is $(0,\infty)$.
			      \end{freeResponse}
			      
			\item Find the $x$-value that gives the minimum surface area over all 
				such boxes.
\WkstHop[2]
				\begin{freeResponse}
        				Our objective function $S(x) = 2x^2 + \frac{108}{x}$ is continuous on the open interval $(0,\infty)$. This domain is an 
        				open interval, so to find the global minimum we start by finding the local extrema.
        				
        				$S'(x) = 4x - \frac{108}{x^2}$. This exists for all nonzero values of $x$, and since $x=0$ is not in our interval of interest,
        				our critical points must have $S'(x)=0$.
        				\begin{align*}
        					S'(x) &= 0\\
        					4x - \frac{108}{x^2} &= 0\\
						4x &= \frac{108}{x^2}\\
						x^3 &= 27\\
						x &= 3.
        				\end{align*} 
        				
        				There is one critical point, at $x=3$. Since $S''(x) = 4 + \frac{216}{x^3}$, we have $S''(3) = 4 + \frac{216}{27} > 0$. By the
        				Second Derivative Test, $x=3$ is a local minimum.
        				
        				Since $x=3$ was the only local extremum on the open interval $(0,\infty)$, it is the global minimum as well.
