\begin{problem}

  A rectangular flower garden with an area of $30 \, m^2$ is surrounded by a grass border $1 \, m$ wide on two sides and $2 \, m$ wide on the other two sides (see figure).
  What dimensions of the garden minimize the combined area of the garden and borders?

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item  Label the picture with variables.

    \item  What are you trying to maximize or minimize?
      Write an equation for it in terms of the variables from (a).
 \item  What is your constraint?
      Write a constraint equation in terms of the variables from (a).
\item  Reduce your optimization equation to one variable using the constraint equation.

    \item  What is the interval on which your variable makes sense?
      Is it open or closed?
      What does this mean for the method of finding the global max or min?
[2]

    \item  Use the appropriate method to find and justify your global extremum.

    \item  Be sure to answer the question asked in the original problem.
