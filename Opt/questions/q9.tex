\begin{problem}
Suppose you own a tour bus and you book groups of $20$ to $80$ people for a day tour. The cost per person is $ \$30$ minus $ \$ 0.25$ for every ticket sold. If gas and other miscellaneous costs are $ \$300$, how many tickets should you sell to maximize your profit? Treat the number of tickets as a nonnegative real number.
  \begin{freeResponse}
  Let $x$ denote the number of tickets sold.
  Then the revenue, $R$ is given by
  \[
  R(x)=x(30-x\cdot 0.25).
  \]
  Therefore, the profit, P,  is given by
  \[
  P(x)=R(x)-C(x)=x(30-x\cdot 0.25)-300.
  \]
  So, we have to find the maximum of the function $P$ on its domain, $[20,80]$.\\
  Since $P$ is continuous on the closed interval, the Extreme Value Theorem guarantees that the maximum of $P$ is attained on $[20,80]$.
  We have to find the critical points of $P$ and evaluate the function at critical points and at end points, and compare the values.\\
  Since
  \[
  P'(x)=30-0.5x
  \]
  we have to solve the equation 
  \[
30-0.5x=0.
  \]
 It follows that the function $P$ has its only critical points at $x=60$.
  Since 
  \[
  P(60)=60(30-60\cdot 0.25)-300=60\cdot 15-300=600,
  \]
  \[
  P(20)=20(30-20\cdot 0.25)-300=20\cdot 25-300=200,
  \]
  \[
   P(80)=80(30-80\cdot 0.25)-300=800-300=500,
  \]
  it follows that the maximum profit is $\$ 600$ and it is attained  when $60$ tickets are sold, i.e. at $x=60$.
