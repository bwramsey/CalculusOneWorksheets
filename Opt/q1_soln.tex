\begin{problem}

  Suppose you want to maximize a continuous function on a closed interval, but you find that it only has one local extremum on the  interval which happens to be a local minimum.
  Where else should you check for the solution? \textbf{EXPLAIN}.
\begin{explanation}
  By the Extreme Value Theorem, the global maximum must occur either at a critical point or at an endpiont of the domain. If the only local extremum is a local minimum, the maximum will occur at one of the endpoints.
\end{explanation}
