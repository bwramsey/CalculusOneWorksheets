\begin{problem}
Suppose you own a tour bus and you book groups of $20$ to $80$ people for a day tour. The cost per person is $ \$30$ minus $ \$ 0.25$ for every ticket sold. If gas and other miscellaneous costs are $ \$300$, how many tickets should you sell to maximize your profit? Treat the number of tickets as a nonnegative real number.
