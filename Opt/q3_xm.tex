\begin{problem}

  A part of a circle centered at the origin with radius $r = 7 \text{ cm}$ is given in the figure (A) below.
  A right triangle is formed in the first quadrant (see figure (A)).
  One of its sides lies on the $x$-axis.
  Its hypotenuse runs from the origin to a point on the circle.
  The hypotenuse makes an angle $\theta$ with the $x$-axis.

  Make sure to label the picture.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      Draw 2 more examples of such a triangle in the figure (B).

    \item
      Express the area of such a triangle as a function of $\theta$ and state its domain.
\item
      Find the value of $\theta$ which maximizes the area in part (b).
      Show your work and justify your answer.
