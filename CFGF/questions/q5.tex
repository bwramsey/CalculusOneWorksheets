\item Domain: $(0,\infty)$

\item $x,y$-intercepts:\\
x-interpects occur when $f(x) = x\ln(x) =0$.  We would think this occurs when either $x=0$ or $ln(x)=0$.  However, $x=0$ is not in the domain.  We only have $ln(x)=0$ which is at $x=1$.
y-intercepts: None given the domain.


\item Symmetry: Given the domain of the function, it does not make sense to check for even/odd.

\item Intervals of increasing/decreasing:

$$f'(x)=\ln(x)+1$$
Find: $f'(x)=\ln(x)+1=0 \implies \ln(x)=-1 \implies x=e^{-1}$\\

Since $f'$ possibly changes its sign at critical points only, the sign of $f'$ is constant on intervals $(0,e^{-1})$ and $(e^{-1},\infty)$. 
Since $f'(1)=1>0$, and $f'(e^{-3})=-3+1=-2<0$, it follows that $f'$ is negative on $(0,e^{-1})$ and positive on $(e^{-1},\infty)$. 

Therefore, $f$ is decreasing on $(0,e^{-1})$ and $f$ is increasing on $(e^{-1},\infty)$. 

\item  Maxima/Minima

Since the function is decreasing on $(0,e^{-1})$ and $f$ is increasing on $(e^{-1},\infty)$., the absolute minimum value of $f$ is attained at $x=e^{-1}$.  The absolute minimum value of $f(x)=f(e^{-1})=e^{-1}\ln e^{-1}=-e^{-1}=-\frac{1}{e}$

The absolute maximum value of $f$ does not exist, since the only critical point is a minimum and $\lim_{x \to \infty}f(x)=+\infty$

\item Intervals of concavity and inflection points:
$f'(x)=\ln(x)+1 \implies f''(x)=\frac{1}{x}>0$ on the domain of $f$.  Concave up on its domain and there are no inflection points.

\item Given $\lim_{x \to 0^+}f(x)=0$, sketch a graph $f$:
