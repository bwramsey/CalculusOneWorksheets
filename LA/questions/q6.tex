  Estimate the amount of paint needed to apply a coat of paint $.05$ cm thick to a hemispherical dome with diameter $50$m. Is this value an underestimate or an overestimate?

  \begin{freeResponse}
	    The radius of the dome is $\frac{50}{2}m=25m$.
	    The paint increases this by 0.0005m (0.05cm to meters).
	    The volume of a ``hemispherical dome'' (or half of a sphere) is $V = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \right) = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^3$.
	    Then
	    $$ \d V = 2 \pi r^2 \d r  $$
	    The amount of paint needed is approximately the change in volume ($\d V$).
	    We also have that $r=25m$ and $\d r = (5 \times 10^{-4}) m$.
	    Thus, the amount of paint needed to paint the dome is approximately
	    $$ \eval{\d V}_{r=25,\d r = 0.0005} = 2 \pi (25)^2 (5 \times 10^{-4}) = 5 \pi (0.125) = 0.625 \pi \approx 1.9635 m^3$$
    
	   The function $V(r) = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^3$ has derivatives $\dfrac{dV}{dr} = 2 \pi r^2$, and $\dfrac{d^2 V}{dr^2} = 4 \pi r$.
	   This second derivative is positive for $r$ in the interval $(25, 25.0005)$, so the graph of $V$ is concave up in that entire interval. 
	   This means the estimate is an underestimate.
