\begin{problem}
	In your own words, explain why $L_a(x)$ is a good approximation of the function $f$ for x values $x \approx a$.

	\begin{freeResponse}
		The graph of $L_a(x)$ is the line tangent to the graph of $f$ at $(a, f(a) )$. 
		For a differentiable function, the tangent line is very close to the graph of the
		function for x-values near that point.
