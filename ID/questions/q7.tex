\begin{problem}
Sketch both the curve $y=\ln(x)$ and the tangent line to the curve at the point  where $x=1$.\\
Then, write an equation of the tangent line to the curve $y=\ln(x)$ at the point where $x=1$.

In order to write an equation of the tangent line we need to find coordinates of the point P$(1, \ln(x))$, and the slope of the line, $y'(1)$.\\
$P(1,0)$, and, since  $y'(x)=\dfrac{1}{x}$, we get that $y'(1)=1$. Therefore, the equation is given by\\
$y=x-1$.
