\begin{problem}
Suppose that a stone is thrown vertically upward from a cliff on Mars with an initial velocity of $24$ ft/s from a height of $192$ ft.  The height $s$ of the stone above the ground after $t$ seconds is given by $s(t) = -6t^2 + 24t + 192$.

	\begin{enumerate}
	
	%part a
	\item  Determine the velocity and acceleration of the stone after $t$ seconds.
%part b
	\item  What is the greatest height of the stone and when does it occur?  What are the velocity and acceleration at that time?
%part c
	\item  When does the stone hit the ground?  What are the velocity and acceleration at that time?
\end{enumerate}
