\begin{problem}
Suppose we know that function $f$ is positive and increasing, and the function $g$ is negative and decreasing. Determine whether the following functions are increasing or decreasing.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The product function: $f(x)g(x)$.
\begin{explanation}
				The derivative of $f(x)g(x)$ is $f'(x) g(x) + f(x) g'(x)$. Since $f$ is increasing and $g$ is decreasing, $f'(x)$ is positive and $g'(x)$ is 
				negative in the interval we are considering. That means $f'(x)g(x)$ is the product of a positive and a negative number, so it is negative. 
				Similary, $f(x)g'(x)$ is the product of a positive number and a negative number, so it is also negative. The result is that 
				$\dfrac{d}{dx}\left( f(x)g(x)\right)$ is negative, so $f(x)g(x)$ is decreasing in the interval.
			\end{explanation}
		\item The composite function: $f(g(x))$.
\begin{explanation}
				The derivative of $f(g(x))$ is $f'( g(x) ) g'(x)$. Since $f$ is increasing and $g$ is decreasing, $f'(x)$ is positive and $g'(x)$ is 
				negative in the interval we are considering. That means $f'(g(x)) g'(x)$ is the product of a positive and a negative number, so it is 		
				negative. The result is that $\dfrac{d}{dx}\left( f(g(x))\right)$ is negative, so $f(x)g(x)$ is decreasing in the interval.
