Consider the parabola $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ where $a,b,c$ are constants.  For what values of $a,b,c$ is $f$ concave up?  For what values of $a,b,c$ is $f$ concave down?

\begin{align*}
f'(x)&=2ax+b\\
f''(x)&=2a
\end{align*}
$\implies$ the sign of $a$ will determine is $f$ is concave up or down.  When $a<0$, $f$ is concave down.  When $a>0$, $f$ is concave up.  Note: If $a=0$, $f$ has no concavity because it is a linear function.
