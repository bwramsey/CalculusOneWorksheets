\begin{problem}
The graph of $h(t)$ represents the height in feet of water in a pool at time $t$ minutes.
			\begin{image}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item During what time intervals is the height of water in the pool increasing? Decreasing?
\item  Assume the rate of change of the water in the pool is $0$ when $t=0$.  For what other values of $t$ is the rate of change of the water in the pool $0$?
\item If $h(t)$ represents the height of the feet in water at time $t$ minutes.  What function represents the rate of change of the height over time?
\item Sketch a graph of the rate of change of the height over time, $h'(t)$.
\end{enumerate}
