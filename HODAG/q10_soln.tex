\begin{problem}	
	\begin{enumerate}
	
	%part a
	\item  True or False:  If the acceleration of an object is constant, then its velocity is constant.
\begin{explanation}
		This is false in general, and is true if and only if the acceleration is 0.  Let $a$ denote your non-zero constant acceleration.  If $a > 0$ then your velocity is increasing, and if $a < 0$ then your velocity is decreasing.  See the accompanying picture for when $a>0$ (note that the units for $v(t)$ and $a(t)$ are \dfn{not} the same!)

	%part b	
	\item  True or False:  A moving object can have negative acceleration and increasing speed.
\begin{explanation}
		True.  If your velocity is negative (which means that you are moving in the negative direction) then a negative acceleration increases the magnitude (or absolute value) of the velocity.  But the magnitude of the velocity is the speed.
