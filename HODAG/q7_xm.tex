\begin{problem}
John is walking along a straight path.  His position at the time $t>0$ is given by $s=f(t)$.  He starts at $t=0$ from his house ($f(0)=0$) and the graph of $f$ is given below.

	%part a
	\item  Describe the motion of John as precisely as you can.
%part b
	\item  When is John's velocity zero?  What is happening to John at those times? 
%part c
	\item  When is John moving in the positive direction?  When is John the furthest in the positive direction and the furthest in the negative direction?
%part d
	\item  When is John's velocity increasing?  And when is it decreasing?  When is John going at maximum velocity?
