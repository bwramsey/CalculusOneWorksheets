\begin{problem}
The total number of people, $N$ who have contracted a common cold by a time $t$ days after its outbreak on an island is given by $N=N(t)= \frac{200000}{1+100e^{-0.1t}},t\geq0$.

	\begin{enumerate}
		%a
		\item Evaluate and interpret the limit $\lim_{t \to \infty} N(t)$
%b
		\item How long will it take for the number of people who have contracted the cold to reach 40,000?
\item The graph of the function $N$ on the interval $[0,100]$ is given below.  Sketch (as best you can) the graph of its derivative, $N'(t)$.

\item Calculate $N'(t)$.  What does $N'(t)$ represent?
\item Evaluate and interpret the limit $\lim_{t \to \infty} N'(t)$
\item Find the average growth rate of the number of people who have contracted the disease during the time interval $[5,6]$ (or during the sixth day after the outbreak).
\item Find the instantaneous growth rate of the number of people who have contracted the disease for $t=5$ (round to a whole number).
\end{enumerate}
