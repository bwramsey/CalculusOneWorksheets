\begin{problem}
 Consider the following two figures depicting the same graph $y=f(x)$ and the same two lines, and the same two points $P$ and $Q$:
  \[
    \begin{array}{lr}
      \includegraphics[trim= 150 350 250 180]{figure2.pdf} &		   \includegraphics[trim= 140 350 250 180]{figure3.pdf}
    \end{array}
  \]
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      In Figure 1 on the left, what are the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$?  In Figure 2 on the right, what are the expressions for the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$?

	\item Express the slope of the secant line through $P$ and $Q$ in terms of the above coordinates for each Figure 1 and Figure 2.

      \item
	Express the slope of the tangent line at the point $P$ in terms of the above coordinates for each Figure 1 and Figure 2.

	\item 
      What is the difference?
      \item 
      For each of the two graphs, which lines are the secant lines?
      \item 
      For each of the two graphs, which lines are the tangent lines?
      \end{enumerate}
