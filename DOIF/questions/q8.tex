  Find the slope of the tangent line to the curve $y = f^{-1}(x)$ at $(4,7)$ if the slope of the tangent line to the curve $y=f(x)$ at $(7,4)$ is $\frac{2}{3}$.

    Note that the statement ``the slope of the tangent line to the curve $y=f(x)$ at $(7,4)$ is $\frac{2}{3}$" specifically means that $f'(7) = \frac{2}{3}$.
    The slope of the tangent line to the curve $y = f^{-1}(x)$ at $(4,7)$ is $(f^{-1})'(4)$, and so we use the formula for the derivative of the inverse function to compute: $(f^{-1})'(4) = \frac{1}{f'(7)} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{3}{2}$.
