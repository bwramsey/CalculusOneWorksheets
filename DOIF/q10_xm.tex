\begin{problem}
A boat sails directly toward a 100-meter skyscraper that stands on the edge of a harbor.  The angular size $\theta$ of the building is the angle formed by lines from the top and bottom of the building to the observer on the boat (see figure below).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Express the angle $\theta$ as the function of $x$, the distance of the boat from the building.
\item The boat is sailing directly toward the skyscraper at $3$ m/s.  Find $\dd[\theta]{t}$ when the boat is $x=300$m from the building.
