\begin{problem}
 Part of the given parabola can be used to model the ``position-time'' graph of a ball thrown straight up into the air.  The graph gives the height of the ball in feet $t$ seconds after being thrown into the air.\\
  Let the function $f$ be defined by  $f(t)=-16t^2+128t+144$.\\
  Use this graph, and the given function, $f$, to answer the following questions.

		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Mark the part of the parabola that can be used to model the position of the ball.		
		\item  What are the units on the $t$ axis?  What are the units on the $y$ axis?
		 \item  If you were watching a movie of the ball being thrown, is the graph a picture of the path that the ball follows?  Why or why not?
		\item Let $f(t)$ denote the height of the ball at time $t, t\geq 0$.  What is the height of the ball at time $t=0$?
		\item  When will the ball hit the ground?
		\item  What is the domain of the position function, $f$, of the ball?

		 \item Use the table of values to find the average velocity of the ball between $t=8.9$ and $t=9$ seconds.
	\[
\begin{array}{|l|l|}
			\hline
			t & \approx f(t)  \\
			\hline
			8.9 & 15.84  \\
			\hline
			8.99 & 1.6  \\
			\hline
			8.999 & 0.159984  \\
			\hline
			8.9999 &  0.015998  \\
			\hline
			9 &  0  \\
			\hline
			\end{array}
		\]
  \item  Use the table of average velocities to approximate the instantaneous velocity of the ball when it hits the ground.
			 \[
			\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{2.5}	
			\begin{array}{|l|l|}
			\hline
			\text{Time Interval} & \text{Average Velocity}  \\
			\hline
			[8.9, 9] & \frac{f(9)-f(8.9)}{.1}=\frac{0-15.84}{.1}=-158.4  \\
			\hline
			[8.99,9] & \frac{f(9)-f(8.99)}{.01}=\frac{0-1.5984}{.01}=-159.84 \\
			\hline
			[8.999, 9] & \frac{f(9)-f(8.999)}{.001}=\frac{0-.159984}{.001}=-159.984 \\
			\hline
			[8.9999, 9] &  \frac{f(9)-f(8.999)}{.0001}=\frac{0-.0159998}{.0001}=-159.998  \\
			\hline
			\end{array} 
			\]

		\item   Compute $v_{AV(t)}$ the average velocity of the ball on the time interval  $[t, 9]$, where $t<9$.

		\item   Compute $v(9)$, the \textbf{instantaneous} velocity of the ball at $t=9$.
