\begin{problem}
The graph of the velocity (t in min, v in ft/min) of a particle moving along a straight line is given in the figure. 
Assume that the particle was at the origin initially.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Evaluate the displacement of the particle over the following intervals.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $[0,10]$
\item $[0,7]$
\item $[0,5]$
\end{enumerate}
\item  When was the particle farthest from the origin?
[3]
		\item  What was  the total distance the particle has travelled over the time interval $[0,10]$?
\end{enumerate}
