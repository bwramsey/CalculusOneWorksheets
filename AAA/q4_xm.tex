\begin{problem}
  The \dfn{velocity} function for a man walking along a straight road which runs east and west is given by $v(t) = -t^2 + 4t - 3$ ft/min.
  \begin{enumerate}
    
  \item  Set up a definite integral for the man's \dfn{displacement} during the time interval from $2$ minutes to $6$ minutes after he began running.
\item  \dfn{At home:}  Evaluate the definite integral using the limit of a right Riemann sum.
\item  Is this the same as the total \dfn{distance} the man walked from $2$ minutes to $6$ minutes?
    Why or why not?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
