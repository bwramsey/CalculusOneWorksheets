We know, from the Antiderivatives section, that \\
(1)  the position function, s(t), of the object moving along a straight line
 with velocity $v(t)$ is an antiderivative of the velocity, i.e.

\[ \int v(t)\d t=s(t) +C\]

(2) the displacement of the object over the time interval $[a,b]$ is given by \\
\[ \text{Displacement} = \Delta s = s(b)- s(a)\]

 In this section, we learned that \\
 (3) the displacement of the object over the time interval $[a,b]$ can be represented \\[0.5em]as the area under the curve $y=v(t)$, (if $v(t)\ge 0$ on $[a,b]$), which means that
\[ \text{Displacement} = \int_{a}^{b} v(t)\d t\]

(4) Combining the last two equations, we get 
\[s(b)-s(a)= \int_{a}^{b} v(t)\d t\]
 \textbf{Note: } The last formula states that a definite integral of a \emph{velocity} function can be computed by using an antiderivative of the function and evaluating it at the and points of the interval.
 This the first time that we make a connection between definite integrals and antiderivatives.
