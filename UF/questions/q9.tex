\begin{problem}
Find the domain of the function.  Determine whether the function is odd, even, or neither.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $f(x)=\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2-9}}$
		\WkstHop
		
		\begin{freeResponse}
			To find the domain, recall that a rational expression cannot have $0$ in the denominator and a square root expression cannot have a negative number under the square root.  Thus, $x^2-9>0$.
			$\implies (x-3)(x+3)>0$  The zeros are located at $x=-3,3$.  From this we can draw a sign chart  for the expression, $x^2-9$, and test values.

			\end{image}
			We see that $x^2-9>0$ on the interval $(-\infty,-3)\cup (3,\infty)$.  Thus our domain is $(-\infty,-3)\cup (3,\infty)$.
	
			Next we check for even/odd/neither.\\
			$f(-x)=\frac{-x}{\sqrt{(-x)^2-9}}$ which does not equal $f(x)$ so $f$ is not even\\
			$-f(x)=-\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2-9}}$ which is equal to $f(-x)$ so $f$ is odd.
		
		\end{freeResponse}

	\item $g(x)= \frac{\sin(x)}{x}$
		\WkstHop
		
		\begin{freeResponse}
		
			To find the domain, recall that a rational expression cannot have $0$ in the denominator.  Therefore, our domain is $(-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)$
			
			Next we check for even/odd/neither.\\
				$f(-x)= \frac{\sin(-x)}{-x}=\frac{-\sin(x)}{-x}=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ which equals $f(x)$ so $f$ is even

		\end{freeResponse}

	\item $h(t)= \ln(t^3-1)$
		\WkstHop
		
		\begin{freeResponse}
		
			To find the domain, recall that we cannot take the natural logarithm of $0$ or a negative number.  Therefore, $t^3-1>0$.
			$\implies (t-1)(t^2+t+1)>0$.  The zero is located at $t=1$.  From this we can draw a sign chart and test values.

			\begin{image}		
				\includegraphics[scale=0.2, alt={Sign-chart showing t^3-1 is negative for t < 1 and positive for t>1.}]{Figure10.png}
			\end{image}

			We see that $t^3-1>0$ on the interval $(1,\infty)$.  Thus our domain is $ (1,\infty)$.\\ \\
		
			Next we check for even/odd/neither.\\
			$h(t)$ is neither even nor odd because if $t$ is in the domain, then $-t$ is not in the domain.
