\begin{problem}
	\begin{enumerate}
   	\item  Let $f(x) = \frac{x-1}{x^2 - 5x}$.  Then $f(2)=-\frac{1}{6}$ and $f(6)=\frac{5}{6}$, but there is no value of $c$ between $2$ and $6$ for which $f(c)=0$.  Does this fact violate the Intermediate Value Theorem?
\item	True or False: At some time since you were born your weight in pounds exactly equaled your height in inches.
\end{enumerate}
