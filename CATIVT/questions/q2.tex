	Recall that \emph{Intervals of Continuity} means the largest such intervals on which the function is continuous.
	
	The function $g$ is continuous on $(\infty, -3)$ since, in this interval, $g(t)=5t+7$ is a polynomial and therefore continuous on its domain.
  
  $g$ is not continuous at $t = -3$:
  \[
    \lim_{t \to -3^-} g(t) = \lim_{t \to -3^-} (5t+7) = 5(-3) + 7 = -8
  \]
  and
  \[
   \lim_{t \to -3^+} g(t)=g(-3) = \frac{(-3-1)(-3+2)}{-3+2} = \frac{4}{-1} = -4.
  \]

Although we have found $g$ is not continuous at $t = -3$, since $\lim_{t \to -3^+} g(t)=g(-3)$, $g$ is continuous from the right at $t=-3$.


  The function $g$ is continuous on $[-3, -2),(-2,1)$ since, in this interval, $g(t) = \frac{(t-1)(t+2)}{t+2}$ is a rational function whose denominator is not zero. $g$ is not continuous at $t=-2$ because it is not defined there.   $g$ is continuous on $(1, \infty)$, since, on this interval, $g(t) =  4 \ln(t)$ is a constant multiple of a  logarithmic function.

$g$ is continuous at $t = 1$:
  \[
    \lim_{t \to 1^-} g(x) = \lim_{t \to 1^-} \frac{(x-1)(x+2)}{x+2} = \frac{0}{3} = 0,
  \]
  and
\[ \lim_{t \to 1^+} g(x)=g(1) = 4 \ln(1) = 0\]


So,  the Intervals of Continuity are \[(-\infty, -3), [-3, -2), (-2, \infty)\].
