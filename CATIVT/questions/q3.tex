Determine the value of a constant $b$ for which $f$ is continuous at $0$. \textbf{EXPLAIN}.
	
	$f(x) =   \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
	\frac{2x+b}{x-5}	 	&	\qquad \text{if } x < 0	\\ \\
	\frac{x+16}{x^2-16}		&	\qquad \text{if } x \ge 0	\end{array} \right.  $

	In order for $f$ to be continuous at $x = 0$, the three conditions of continuity have to be satisfied.  These criteria are:
	\begin{center}
		  $f$ is defined at $x = 0$\\

	     	 $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x)$ exists\\

	    	  $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = f(0)$
	\end{center}

The first condition is satisfied.  In order to satisfy the second condition,  $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x)$ exists, we must verify that $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x)=\lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x)=\lim_{x \to 0^-} f(x)$.
That is, 
	\begin{align*}
		\lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x)&=\lim_{x \to 0^+} \left(\frac{x+16}{x^2-16}\right)=\frac{16}{-16}=-1\\
		\lim_{x \to 0^-} f(x)&=\lim_{x \to 0^-}\frac{2x+b}{x-5}=\frac{b}{-5}\\
		\implies & \lim_{x \to 0} f(x)=-1=\frac{-b}{5} \implies b=5
	\end{align*}

and $f(0)=-1$. $f$ is continuous at $x=0$ for $b=5$ since  $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x)=f(0)=1$.
	
	Notice here, it's not enough to just find a value for $b$. Our work must also justify the continuity at $x=0$ for that value of $b$.
