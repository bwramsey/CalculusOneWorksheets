\begin{problem}
	\begin{enumerate}
   	\item  Let $f(x) = \frac{x-1}{x^2 - 5x}$.  Then $f(2)=-\frac{1}{6}$ and $f(6)=\frac{5}{6}$, but there is no value of $c$ between $2$ and $6$ for which $f(c)=0$.  Does this fact violate the Intermediate Value Theorem?
\begin{explanation}
        It does not violate the Intermediate Value Theorem.  $f$ is not continuous at 5 so the conditions of the IVT do not hold and therefore the IVT does not apply.
      \end{explanation}

	\item	True or False: At some time since you were born your weight in pounds exactly equaled your height in inches.
\begin{explanation}
        True: if $w(t)$ represents your weight in pounds at time at time $t$ and $h(t)$ represents your height in inches at time $t$, then $w$ and $h$ are both continuous functions.  This implies $w - h$ is also continuous.
        If $t = 0$ is the moment you where born and $t = T_0$ is the present time, then $w(0) - h(0) < 0$ and $w(T_0) - h(T_0) > 0$.
        Hence by the Intermediate Value Theorem there is a point in the past, $t$, when $w(t)-h(t)=0$ and therefore your weight in pounds equaled your height in inches.
      \end{explanation}
