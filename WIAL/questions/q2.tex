\begin{problem}
Use the graphs and the given definitions of the following two functions to answer the questions below.
	
	\begin{image}
		\includegraphics[scale = 0.7, alt={Graph of f(x) = (x^2-1)/(x-1)}]{graphRationalFunction.png}
	\end{image}

	\begin{image}
	        \includegraphics[scale = 0.7, alt={Graph of g(x) = x+1}]{graphLinearFunction.png}
	\end{image}

	\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Find the domain of $f$ and the domain of $g$.
	\WkstHop

	      \begin{freeResponse}
		        The domain of $f$ is $(-\infty, 1) \cup (1, \infty)$ (all real numbers except $1$).
		        The domain of $g$ is $(-\infty, \infty)$ (all real numbers).
	      \end{freeResponse}
	
  	\item Is $f = g$? (Why or why not?)
	\WkstHop

      \begin{freeResponse}
	        No, these two functions are not equal.
	        Two functions are equal if and only if they have identical domains and their values agree on all points in the domain.
	
	        Since $f$ and $g$ have different domains, by part (a), they cannot be equal functions.
	\end{freeResponse}
	
	 \item  Looking at the graphs, find $\lim_{x \to 1} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x \to 1} g(x)$.
\WkstHop

      \begin{freeResponse}
        From the graphs we have that $\lim_{x \to 1} f(x) = 2$ and $\lim_{x \to 1} g(x) = 2$.
      \end{freeResponse}

	\end{enumerate}
